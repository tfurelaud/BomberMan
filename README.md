## Rules ##

This game is similar to a classic "Bomber Man". This is a *standalone* version of the game for a single player. In this version, a single character (or player) starts the game with an initial amount of 50 health points. Each fruit brings a character with 10 extra health points, while each bomb blast removes 10 health points. A character is dead when its health points reach zero. A character gets immunity for a while after he's hit by a bomb blast. After a character drops a bomb, he is disarmed for a while.

To play, just use the following keys:
  * use *arrows* to move the current character
  * press *space* to drop a bomb at current position, that will explode after a delay of 5 seconds
  * press *escape* to quit the game

The implementation of this game follows a simple MVC architecture (Model/View/Controller).
